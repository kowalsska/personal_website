In June 2017 I got a 2010 Opel Movano with the idea of turning it into a mobile home and moving into and driving it all across Europe(and possibly beyond). Having spent a big chunk of my childhood traveling in a campervan with my family, it seemed like an obvious thing to do. After an initial first month of working on the van I didn't get very far but was super stoked on the idea. In the end it led me to the decision of quitting my job at Morgan Stanley, moving back home to Poland and focusing entirely on the van. My friend came over and stayed for over a month, helping me out throughout the process.

None of us really had any idea or skill in carpentry, but we just figured stuff out along the way. After a month of hard work we knew the end is not anywhere close, so we randomly booked one way tickets to Thailand and disappeared for a couple of months. You can read about this travel here.
<br><br>
I returned home 6 months later, landed a remote job in the meantime and decided to finish the van. This time on my own.
It was an exciting process and I got super hooked on carpentry. I still believe that biggest achievement of the van conversion project is the fact that I still have all 10 fingers. The van finally started to look like home.

In August 2018 the van was finally ready. My friend Avi and I took it on a maiden voyage across Poland. It was an extremely rewarding experience. Driving, cooking, sleeping, living in a fully functional campervan I made myself. Oooft!

Over the course of 6 months I traveled in the campervan from Poland to Morocco and back while working remotely and charging my laptop using the solar panel mounted to the roof of the van. It was great fun!
<br><br>
None of this would've been possible without Bryony's, Alex's, Peter's, Dorota', Mira's snd Jasiu's help. Thank you all!
