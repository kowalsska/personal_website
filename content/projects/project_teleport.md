As my final year university project I decided to develop a mobile app. It's a location based photo sharing app that I called Teleport. The project aimed at researching a new way through which people could communicate with each other. Taking into account all the existing photo sharing and communication apps, I came up with a novel idea where the users can request content from anywhere on a map and receive pictures of the locations that are only visible for a limited amount of time. Basically, the app allows you to <span style='font-style: italic'>teleport</span> wherever you want using your phone and the help of community that uses the app.
