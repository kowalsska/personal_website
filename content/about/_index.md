Hi, I'm Magda. I created this website as a personal project to learn something new and share with people projects I work on and things I do.
I'm currently based in San Francisco, CA where I work as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.getaround.com/">Getaround</a>, a company that empowers people to carshare everywhere. In my free time I often rent Getaround cars to go climbing, cycling or surfing around California. Before moving to US, I worked remotely as a full stack engineer at <a href="https://www.ohmconnect.com/">OhmConnect</a> while driving my van across Europe to Morocco.
Hope you find my website interesting. Please feel free to get in touch if you have any questions..
