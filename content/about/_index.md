Hi there, I'm Magda. <br>

I'm a Senior Software Engineer with over 8 years of experience building scalable systems that solve real problems. My expertise lies in Python, distributed systems and API integrations.<br>

I've worked across diverse industries, from healthcare technology at GrowTherapy to electric vehicle infrastructure at WeaveGrid, mobility platforms at Getaround, and smart home technology at Awair and OhmConnect. <br>

This journey took me through the Bay Area and NYC startup scenes between 2019 and 2025. After 6 years in the US, I recently moved back to Europe and I'm now based on the coast of Portugal.<br>

My current interests include: 
<ul>
    <li>AI ethics and algorithmic transparency</li>
    <li>financial access for underserved communities using crypto</li>
    <li>climate tech that accelerates the clean energy transition</li>
</ul>

If you work in any of those areas and would like to work on something together, please get in touch! I'm particularly interested in working with non-profits. <br>
