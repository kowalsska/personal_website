Hi there, I'm Magda. 
I work as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.weavegrid.com/">WeaveGrid</a>, a company that uses machine learning to inteligently connect electric vehicles to the grid with the goal of reducing their environmental impact and to protect the grid during peak demand hours. In my free time I surf, climb or search for adventure in my van. Before moving to US in 2019, I worked remotely as a Full Stack Engineer at <a href="https://www.ohmconnect.com/">OhmConnect</a> while driving my van across Europe to Morocco.
Hope you find my website interesting. Please feel free to get in touch if you have any questions..
