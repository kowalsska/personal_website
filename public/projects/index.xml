      <description>In 2015 I lucky to be invited by the FemEng (Female Engineering) society from University of Glasgow to help them organise their first edition of &amp;ldquo;FemEng in Rwanda&amp;rdquo; project. We collaborated with students from University of Rwanda in Kigali and organised workshops about science and engineering for school girls in the Kigali area.
With the mix of aspiring engineers specialising in different fields we created workshops about Biomedical, Mechanical, Civil, Aerospace and Software engineering.</description>

      <description>As my final year university project I decided to develop a mobile app. It&amp;rsquo;s a location based photo sharing app that I called Teleport. The project aimed at researching a new way through which people could communicate with each other. Taking into account all the existing photo sharing and communication apps, I came up with a novel idea where the users can request content from anywhere on a map and receive pictures of the locations that are only visible for a limited amount of time.</description>
